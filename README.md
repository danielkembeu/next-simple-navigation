# Simple Nextjs Demo

## Description

Just a project to make somebody to learn something about React and Nextjs that you struggle with.
@Vannelle

## Features

### Navigation

- Using the `Link` component
- Using the `Dynamic Route` for products, located in the `/products/single-product/[id]`
- Using the `useParams` hook from `next/link` to retrieve the URL parameter, like the product ID.

### Design Patterns

- Reusable Components
- Using the `SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)`
- Using `Props` with `Props' types`
- Using `Custom hook` to add shareable functionality accross the components.

### Core: Nextjs

- Using `Client components` by marking them with the `use client` directive, in the `SingleProduct component`.

### Styling

- Using `Tailwind CSS` to style my components
- Adaptable styles for both `light` and `dark` modes.
